            When I moved to France for my year out to study, I was often asked how I learned French (and so
            quickly). My answer to these questions generally went:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I happened to listen to a lot of French music and heard how it sounds and picked up
                    pronunciation and
                    prosody.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I gradually accumulated a small vocabulary from repeated exposure.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I learned some phrases that were useful to me with the French speakers I knew.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I sat down one day and learned the verb tenses and grammar that is useful to me and easy to
                    understand.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            By the time I would get to the last step, my French accent was more or less better than most English
            people, and, while I couldn't form creative or correct sentences, I did know how to talk about
            things that mattered to me.
        </li>
        <li>
            I was, of course, hugely benefitting from my already fluent Spanish. Hence, much of my vocabulary
            and grammar was merely <i>francophised</i> from either English or Spanish whenever I couldn't
            remember a word.
        </li>
        <li>
            I also happened to take a module in French that lasted for the whole academic year. While the module
            may not have been so dense in its teachings, it did add some structure to my learning and made sure
            I understood the most basic grammar. Importantly, it also gave me some time to speak French, which
            was supplemented by my very kind friend Sixtine offering to speak to me for an hour each week in
            French. She was such an amazing asset to my learning as we were good friends and she did not pull
            any punches in point out my mistakes.
        </li>
        <li>
            It is now 2 years since the day I moved to France. My French improved hugely thanks to the ~8 months
            I was there, but I recognise that this is not always an option for people. So now that I plan to
            learn Swedish, I am going to document all of the methods that I use to do it as quickly and
            effectively as possible.

                <b>Grammar Books</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        There are generally two levels of grammar books: those titled <i>Essential</i> and those titled
                        <i>Comprehensive</i>. While I do find comprehensive grammars to be curious while learning
                        <i>about</i> a language and its features and quirks, I do not find them to be good learning
                        materials when starting out.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Essential grammars, on the other hand, do provide a great source of all of the basic aspects of
                        a languages grammar, pronunciation, and some tips on modern usage. The one I am currently
                        studying from is <i>Swedish. An Essential Grammar - Holmes and Hinchliffe</i> and it does a good
                        job explaining things with a balance of linguistic rigour and kindness to learners.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This is not, however, the first Swedish book I used to learn the grammar. In fact, this was the
                        only book about Swedish available in the University of Warwick e-library: <i>The Acquisition of
                            Swedish Grammar</i>. This book focused on contributing to the theories of language
                        acquisition, but also included an intense, linguistics jargon heavy introduction to the salient
                        aspects of Swedish grammar which I found myself rapidly skimming over. I felt like it gave me a
                        good overview of what to expect: a language that, much like English, is easy to communicate in
                        but difficult to become native-level fluent in.

                <b>Children's Stories</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Due to my upbringing in an Afrikaans speaking household, I can understand germanic languages
                        better than most English people who have never actually learned germanic language (although this
                        does depend on your definition of <it>learn</it>). This lends me to quickly trying to see the
                        language in context in its simplest form which tends to be children's stories. That is not to
                        say that these are at all a walk in the park â€” it is actually quite the opposite. As children
                        learn to speak first and read later, books for children assume that they already have a grasp of
                        the spoken language. This means that any number of difficult concepts can be thrown at you from
                        the beginning, which can be quite frustrating.

                        My advice would be to try to find books that are mostly for adults to read to younger children.
                        You know the sort: <i>Max the Dog Buys Flowers for His Mum</i>. Few words, simple sentences.

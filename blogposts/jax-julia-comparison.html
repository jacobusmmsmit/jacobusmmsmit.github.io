        <h1>My thoughts on JAX and Julia</h1>

        <p>One of the best things any programmer can do is learn another
            language. It forces you to think in a different way to solve problems
            and expands your mental and technical toolboxes. After working in both
            languages on multiple projects, I would recommend everyone using either
            JAX or Julia learn to use the other.</p>
        <h2 id="shared-attributes">Shared attributes</h2>
        <p>I consider both languages to be advanced tools in the realm of
            scientific computing. JAX offers a DSL with many restrictions on
            function purity and control flow and Julia‚Äôs language design requires
            careful thought to be fully taken advantage of in all but the simplest
            of applications.</p>
        <p>Writing code without a proper understanding of how the respective
            tools work will result in frustrating, error-prone development
            potentially leading to inefficient code. Compare this to NumPy, for
            example, which places far fewer restrictions on what is or isn‚Äôt a valid
            expression as it doesn‚Äôt have the same goals, namely performance and
            correctness, as the more constraining tools.</p>
        <p>On the flipside, with an appreciation for the inner mechanics of the
            compiler one can write concise code to perform complex transformations.
            Moreover, this code will be free of the syntactic noise found in
            traditional performant approaches and the delicate, hacky tendencies of
            simpler tools.</p>
        <p>Luckily, another strength of both tools is the community supporting
            them. If a user is struggling with a particular problem or wants some
            advice on their code then there are many sponges of knowledge lurking on
            the discussion platforms ‚Äî primarily Discourse for Julia and GitHub for
            JAX ‚Äî and so no question (following the <a
                href="https://discourse.julialang.org/t/please-read-make-it-easier-to-help-you/14757">guidelines</a>)
            is left unanswered. Unfortunately, this has the consequence that a lot
            of information is buried in discussions or the brains of a clever few,
            something that is especially impactful as documentation can be lacking
            in some areas. While these may be mostly edge cases, the curse of
            dimensionality tells us that if a project is complicated enough, it‚Äôs
            very likely that one will run into a problem that can only be solved by
            such information.</p>
        <h2 id="julia-is-less-restrictive">Julia is less restrictive</h2>
        <p>The approach taken by Julia‚Äôs core creators is that Julia is a
            general-purpose language and is more than capable of being used beyond
            scientific computing. Its allows a mix of procedural and functional
            code, offers strong meta-programming capabilities, and has libraries
            stretching nearly every domain.</p>
        <p>As alluded to earlier, JAX is specifically built for high-performance
            machine learning research. To this end, while it comes as a Python
            extension (or two), it functions as a functional array programming
            language that leaves everything unrelated to this to its host
            language.</p>
        <p>The restrictions JAX imposes are very well explained in <a
                href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html">its
                documentation</a> and this provides a refreshingly simple list of things
            that the programmer has to take into account while reasoning about the
            implementation of an algorithm. In summary, functions must be pure,
            arrays are immutable and the limited updates it allows are performed
            out-of-place, compiled function arguments must be JAX arrays or directly
            derived therefrom, if-statements cannot depend on run-time values, and
            random numbers require slightly more than zero effort.</p>
        <p>Julia‚Äôs comparatively permissive attitude is fantastic for those who
            ‚Äújust want things to work‚Äù until the user inevitably notices how
            painfully slow their program is running and either complains to the
            community or goes back to Python. It is precisely because of its
            general-purpose goal that the language hands out footguns so freely.
            Unwilling to impose what is or isn‚Äôt possible, it won‚Äôt make so much as
            a peep when encountering untyped global variables, a type instability in
            the output of a function, abstract typed containers or an instruction to
            heap-allocate the same vector a million times even if it never leaves
            scope.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, if you are in a field that JAX is designed for
            then everything you‚Äôll need to do just works. In my personal experience,
            JAX‚Äôs limitations are a blessing more often than a curse. The fact that
            the ‚Äúone way to be correct‚Äù is functional is a core part of why JAX
            <em>feels</em> so good as it is a completely natural way of thinking
            about the maths-heavy domain of machine learning and data science. In
            comparison, when I program in Julia I often <em>want</em> to write code
            functionally, but can‚Äôt afford to for performance reasons because a
            for-loop would be so much faster. I applaud the fact that I can write
            tacit functions with the unicode character <code>‚ö¨</code> meaning
            composition (e.g. <code>gcd ‚ö¨ collect ‚ö¨ extrema</code> from <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWgcukcpo9A">this fun series</a>),
            but I weep when I have to go from thinking in terms of high-level array
            transformations to thinking in terms of for-loops, indices, and
            procedural updates.

        <h2 id="julias-packaging-benchmarking-and-help-tools-are-unmatched-by-python">Julia‚Äôs
            packaging, benchmarking, and help tools are unmatched by Python</h2>
        <p>Rust‚Äôs Cargo is the gold standard. For such a complex language, Cargo
            is a beacon of user-friendly design (and btw it‚Äôs üî• blazingly fast üî•).
            Leaning heavily on Cargo‚Äôs shoulders, Pkg makes doing things the right
            way easy. It makes environments, dependency management and packaging
            painless, which is incredibly valuable as we try to break out of the
            replication crisis.</p>
        <p>The best efforts in the Python ecosystem to replicate Cargo <del>‚Äôs
                successes</del> are Poetry (v1.0 in December 2019) and Hatch (v1.0 in
            April 2022). However, their adoption has been less-than-instant in the
            scientific community, a people well known for unenthusiastically
            learning badly-designed software and developing Stockholm syndrome once
            something new comes along.</p>
        <p>What these packaging tools don‚Äôt enjoy is the same level of
            integration into their target language as Julia‚Äôs Pkg. Julia‚Äôs REPL
            could be a section all on its own, but its Pkg mode makes it trivial to
            do useful but odd things like test out a new package, only to uninstall
            it 30s later.</p>
        <p>Similarly, <code>?</code> mode in the REPL is amazing, especially
            when package developers design around it. Not having to close my window
            to look up documentation on pretty much anything is a great benefit and
            going back to Python feels like a complete paradigm shift.</p>
        <p>Finally, once you‚Äôve used BenchmarkTools you never want to go back to
            timeit. Compared to timeit‚Äôs bizarre syntax, the builtin
            <code>@time</code> and BenchmarkTools‚Äô <code>@btime</code> and
            <code>@benchmark</code> allow you to annotate a line of code and
            immediately know its distribution of execution times, how many
            allocations occur, and the total space allocated.
        </p>
        <h2 id="julia-is-always-compiled-jax-has-python-as-a-fallback">Julia is
            always compiled, JAX has Python as a fallback</h2>
        <p>The compiled nature of both tools means that the time between running
            a script and seeing results is far larger than an interpreted language
            like Python. It‚Äôs no secret that JAX‚Äôs compilation takes far longer than
            Julia‚Äôs in many cases, but the fact that JAX users can selectively
            compile bits of their code means that one of Julia‚Äôs biggest pain
            points, time-to-first-X, can be completely sidestepped.</p>
        <h2 id="python-is-a-limiting-surrogate-language-for-jax">Python is a
            limiting surrogate language for JAX</h2>
        <p>Julia was designed around multiple dispatch. Its system of abstract,
            concrete, and parametric types give rise to an incredibly useful toolbox
            for writing generic, performant code. It also provides simple,
            extensible ways for handling many problems that occur commonly in
            science, such as missing values handled through the <code>Missing</code>
            type. As a side effect, the type system also provides another one of
            Julia‚Äôs more frustrating points: time-to-first-<code>Method Error</code>
            (as anyone who has used autodiff in Julia will know).</p>
        <p>Python‚Äôs type system is a cobbled together afterthought that looks
            especially weak in the current landscape of programming languages. JAX
            unfortunately suffers for this, even in its limited scope of array
            programming, and examples can be seen in the existence and design of <a
                href="https://github.com/google/jaxtyping">jaxtyping</a>. jaxtyping is a
            fantastic package which essentially builds a new parametric type system
            out of strings.</p>
        <h2 id="which-tool-should-i-use">Which tool should I use?</h2>
        <p>JAX and Julia are powerful tools that require a non-trivial amount of
            investment to wield fully. JAX‚Äôs more restrictive approach means that it
            is the perfect tool for its limited scope, requiring less investment to
            master than its competitor. Julia main goal was to solve the
            two-language problem and it has done so fairly well. Its limitations to
            more widespread adoption in science come mostly from its frustrating
            error messages, slow compilation speed, incredibly high
            knowledge-ceiling of mastery, and lack of teaching tools (and a
            JetBrains designed IDE).</p>
        <p>Speaking on the subjects that I have worked on myself: * for pure
            deep learning and machine learning research I would recommend JAX,
            particularly <a href="https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox">Equinox</a> for those
            coming from Julia and are used to a high degree of composability. * for
            scientific projects in applied machine learning (or really any domain
            where you would be gluing JAX code into Python) then Julia was made for
            you. The SciML ecosystem is fantastic and its documentation is pretty
            extensive.</p>

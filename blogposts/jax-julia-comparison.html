        <p>I consider both languages to be advanced tools in the realm of
            scientific computing. JAX offers a DSL with many restrictions on
            function purity and control flow, likewise writing idiomatic code is
            necessary to achieve maximum performance in Julia.</p>
        <p>Writing code without a proper understanding of how the respective
            tools work will result in frustrating, error-prone development
            potentially leading to inefficient code. Compare this to NumPy, for
            example, which places far fewer restrictions on what is or isn’t a valid
            expression as it doesn’t have the same goals, namely performance and
            correctness, as the more constraining tools.</p>
        <p>On the flipside, with an appreciation for the inner mechanics of
            their compilers one can write concise code to perform complex
            transformations. Moreover, this code will be free of the syntactic noise
            found in traditional performant approaches and the hacky tendencies of
            simpler tools.</p>
        <p>Luckily, another strength of both tools is the community supporting
            them. If a user is struggling with a particular problem or wants some
            advice on their code then there are many sponges of knowledge lurking on
            the discussion platforms — primarily Discourse for Julia and GitHub for
            JAX — and so no question (following the <a
                href="https://discourse.julialang.org/t/please-read-make-it-easier-to-help-you/14757">guidelines</a>)
            is left unanswered. Consequently, however, a lot of information is
            buried in threads or the brains of a clever few, something that is
            especially impactful as documentation of advanced concepts is lacklustre
            (more so for Julia). While these may be mostly edge cases, the curse of
            dimensionality tells us that if a project is complicated enough, one is
            very likely to encounter a problem that can only be solved by such
            information.</p>
        <h2 id="julia-is-less-restrictive">Julia is less restrictive</h2>
        <p>The approach taken by Julia’s core creators is that Julia should be a
            general-purpose language. Its allows a mix of procedural and functional
            code, offers strong meta-programming capabilities, and has libraries
            stretching to nearly every scientific domain.</p>
        <p>As alluded to earlier, JAX is specifically built for high-performance
            machine learning research. While delivered as a Python extension (or
            two), it acts as a functional array programming language that leaves
            everything unrelated to this to its host language.</p>
        <p>The restrictions JAX imposes are well covered in <a
                href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html">its
                documentation</a> and this provides a refreshingly simple list of things
            that the programmer has to take into account while reasoning about the
            implementation of an algorithm. In summary, functions must be pure,
            arrays are immutable and the limited updates it allows are performed
            out-of-place, compiled function arguments must be JAX arrays or directly
            derived therefrom, if-statements cannot depend on run-time values, and
            random numbers require slightly more than zero effort.</p>
        <p>Julia’s comparatively permissive attitude is fantastic for those who
            “just want things to work” until the user inevitably notices how
            painfully slow their program is running and either complains to the
            community or goes back to Python. It is precisely because of its
            general-purpose goal that the language hands out footguns so freely.
            Unwilling to impose what is or isn’t possible, it won’t make so much as
            a peep when encountering untyped global variables, a type instability in
            the output of a function, abstract typed containers or an instruction to
            heap-allocate the same vector a million times even if it never leaves
            scope.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, if you are in a field that JAX is designed for
            then everything works out of the box. In my personal experience, JAX’s
            limitations are a blessing more often than a curse. The fact that it
            forces the functional paradigm is a core part of why JAX <em>feels</em>
            so good as it is a natural way of solving problems in maths-heavy
            domains like deep learning. In comparison, when I program in Julia I
            often <em>want</em> to write code functionally, but can’t afford to for
            performance reasons because a for-loop would be so much faster. I
            applaud the fact that I can write tacit functions with the unicode
            character <code>⚬</code> meaning composition
            (e.g. <code>gcd ⚬ collect ⚬ extrema</code> from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWgcukcpo9A">this
                fun series</a>),
            but I weep when I have to go from thinking in terms of high-level array
            transformations to thinking in terms of for-loops, indices, and
            procedural updates.</p>
        <h2 id="julias-utility-tools-are-unmatched-by-python-and-jax">Julia’s
            utility tools are unmatched by Python and JAX</h2>
        <p>Rust’s Cargo is the gold standard. For such a complex language, Cargo
            is a beacon of user-friendly design (and btw it’s ⚡ blazingly fast ⚡).
            Leaning heavily on Cargo’s shoulders, Pkg makes it easy to do
            environments, dependency management and packaging in a reproducible way,
            an asset amidst science’s replication crisis.</p>
        <p>The best efforts in the Python ecosystem to replicate Cargo <del>’s
                successes</del> are Poetry (v1.0 in December 2019) and Hatch (v1.0 in
            April 2022). However, their adoption has been less-than-instant in the
            scientific community, a people well known for unenthusiastically
            learning badly-designed software and developing Stockholm syndrome once
            something new comes along.</p>
        <p>Even so, Python’s tools are not as integrated into their target
            language as Julia’s Pkg. The REPL could be a section all on its own, but
            its Pkg mode, activated with a single input (<code>]</code>), makes it
            trivial to do useful but odd things like test out a new package, only to
            uninstall it 30s later. Similarly, <code>?</code> mode in the REPL
            improves productivity by letting users fuzzy-search documentation of
            functions, macros, and types.</p>
        <p>Finally, once you’ve used BenchmarkTools you never want to go back to
            timeit, whose bizarre syntax requires looking up every time I use it.
            Julia’s inbuilt <code>@time</code> and BenchmarkTools’
            <code>@btime</code> and <code>@benchmark</code> allow you to annotate a
            line of code and immediately know its distribution of execution times,
            how many allocations occur, and the total space allocated. Furthermore,
            Julia’s profiler shows where allocations occur as of v1.8 (previously
            just execution time), and can be invoked and viewed by the
            <code>@profview</code> macro that comes with Julia’s VSCode
            extension.
        </p>
        <p>The popularity of Jupyter notebooks for scientific Python development
            is no surprise given the productivity boost magic commands like
            <code>%timeit</code> and <code>%prun</code> provide.
        </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, JAX itself is difficult to profile. The opaque names
            of operations in the graphical trace means it can be difficult to
            determine what’s going on or what has happened to your code.</p>
        <h2 id="julia-is-always-compiled-jax-has-python-as-a-fallback">Julia is
            always compiled, JAX has Python as a fallback</h2>
        <p>The compiled nature of both tools means that the time between running
            a script and seeing results is far larger than an interpreted language
            like Python. It’s no secret that JAX’s compilation takes far longer than
            Julia’s in many cases, but the fact that JAX users can selectively
            compile bits of their code means that one of Julia’s biggest pain
            points, time-to-first-X, can be completely sidestepped.</p>
        <h2 id="python-is-a-limiting-surrogate-language-for-jax">Python is a
            limiting surrogate language for JAX</h2>
        <p>Julia was designed around multiple dispatch. Its system of abstract,
            concrete, and parametric types give rise to an incredibly useful toolbox
            for writing generic, performant code. It also provides simple,
            extensible ways for handling many problems that occur commonly in
            science, such as missing values handled through the <code>Missing</code>
            type. As a side effect, the type system also provides another one of
            Julia’s more frustrating points: time-to-first-<code>Method Error</code>
            (as anyone who has used autodiff in Julia will know).</p>
        <p>Python’s type system is a cobbled together afterthought that looks
            especially weak in the current landscape of programming languages. JAX
            unfortunately suffers for this, even in its limited scope of array
            programming and especially when compounded with its meagre capacity for
            metaprogramming. While a powerful tool like <a href="https://github.com/google/jaxtyping">jaxtyping</a> can
            provide the
            capability to perform compile-time shape/type checking on JAX arrays (at
            no performance cost!), it essentially builds a new parametric type
            system out of strings to do so.</p>
        <h2 id="which-tool-should-i-use">Which tool should I use?</h2>
        <p>JAX and Julia are powerful tools that require a non-trivial amount of
            investment to wield. JAX’s restrictive approach means that it is the
            perfect tool for its limited scope. Julia main goal was to solve the
            two-language problem and it has done so fairly well*. Its limitations to
            more widespread adoption in science come mostly from its frustrating
            error messages, slow compilation speed, incredibly high
            knowledge-ceiling of mastery, and lack of teaching tools (and a
            JetBrains designed IDE).</p>
        <p>Once mastered, both JAX and Julia can be used in almost all
            scientific settings. That said, using JAX in a domain where reasoning in
            a functional way is difficult then inexperienced JAX users may struggle.
            Furthermore, JAX’s fundamental transformations is built for SIMD-heavy
            operations that run on GPUs/TPUs so code not taking advantage of
            <code>vmap</code> may run faster in Julia.
        </p>
        <p>For Julia, hell is other people’s code. The ecosystem is highly
            developed in certain areas (see <a href="https://sciml.ai/">SciML</a>
            for example) but stability and fragmentation are issues in others. If
            one has a lot of domain knowledge and is planning to write a lot of
            custom code then Julia is a great language to choose.</p>
        <p>*Although ultra-performant Julia code can sometimes read like a
            different language</p>

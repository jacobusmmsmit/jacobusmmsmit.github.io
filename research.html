                        <li>This extended abstract dives into an example from Dawkins' book <i>The Selfish Gene</i>,
                            where
                            different types of birds have evolved different ways of raising their young. We present an
                            evolutionary game theory approach and then show that agent based modelling can be used to
                            aid in the identification of equilibrium states, which are known to be computationally
                            complex to find.
